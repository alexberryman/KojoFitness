# KōjōFitness
Fitness functions for [Kōjō](https://github.com/neighborhoods/kojo).

These are examples to prove and provide insight into specific aspects and attributes of Kojo.

Each `FunctionXY` directory contains a README.md detailing its specifics.
`X` refers to the major version of Kojo. `Y` is an increment for the function, but is not tied to the minor/patch version of kojo.
